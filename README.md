# hello-world
we all need to start somewhere

this is mostly going to be used for research for a story I'm writing.
and already i'm falling in love with the interface. 
it reminds me of when i used to use a DOS computer in the 90s.
i wish i remembered all those commands i used to know.
i'm sure they'll come back.
